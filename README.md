# higher ed
we would like you to apply what you already know about business intelligence and be prepared to discuss an interesting analysis that would be appropriate for higher education. Feel free to be creative and to share any part of the analytical process (i.e organizing/modeling data, measures created, presentation of final product, tools used, test/deployment, questions answered/relevance).
